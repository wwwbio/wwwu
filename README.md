RESEARCH INTERESTS
My lab focuses on adaptive evolution of angiosperms toward abiotic stresses, drought, salt, cold, and rising temperatures. Most of my effort has been concentrating to employ phylogenomics, phylotranscriptomics, and regulatory maps to reveal cis- and trans-regulatory evolution underlying phenotypic variations involved in abiotic stresses and validate their functional roles and molecular mechanisms by genetic and biochemical experiments.
